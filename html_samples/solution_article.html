            <h2>MAKING COMPLEX REQUIREMENTS TRANSPARENT</h2>

            <h3>PERFECT PLANNING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING</h3>

            <p>At a time of rapid technological and scientific change a number of new questions and challenges are
                posed<br />
                <b>which must be taken into consideration during the planning stage of a hospital or laboratory.</b>
            </p>

            <p>How can new devices be flexibly integrated into an existing OR?<br />
                What devices and connections must be planned for in the operating room or laboratory?<br />
                How can the paths for patients, personnel and material be designed in the best possible way?<br />
                These examples show that variable and flexible concepts form the basis of the introduction<br />
                and <b>implementation of complex solutions in hospital and laboratory</b> construction.</p>

            <p><b>The objectives and demands of the various parties involved, such as specialist planners, medical
                    staff,<br />
                    technical service staff and architects must be fully taken into account.</b></p>

            <p>An essential element for successful project management is thus the integration of all those involved
                both internally<br />
                and externally. When doing this, the main focus must always be on <b>the objective of ensuring the
                    best possible<br />
                    use of resources for medical and scientific operation.</b></p>

                    Whole building complexes are virtually created on the PC and present a realistic image right from
